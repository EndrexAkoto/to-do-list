# To-Do List Web Application

A simple and interactive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It also includes a color palette feature that lets users choose a background color for the tasks and the entire page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task" or press "Enter" to add it to the list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Click the "Edit" button next to a task to change its text.
- **Delete Tasks**: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Click on a task to toggle its completion status.
- **Color Palette**: Choose a background color for the tasks and the entire page from the color palette.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and interactivity.
- **LocalStorage**: Persistent storage for tasks.

## Getting Started

3. **Open `index.html` in a Web Browser**:
    - You can open the file directly in a web browser by double-clicking it or using a local server to view it.

## File Structure

3. **Deleting a Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to the task you want to remove.
4. **Completing a Task**: Click on a task to mark it as completed. It will be styled with a line-through and change color to indicate its status.
5. **Changing Background Color**: Click on a color option in the color palette to change the background color of the tasks and the entire page.
